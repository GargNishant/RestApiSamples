1. edit the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file and make sure, either
    you have bind-address           = 0.0.0.0 (meaning accepting from all addresses)
    or you comment the line #bind-address ...
You may need to add it to the mysqld section of the my.cnf file:
[mysqld]
bind-address = 0.0.0.0
make sure to restart your mysql server after the change
$ sudo service mysql restart
