1. Install MySQL Server in Machine using:
sudo apt-get install mysql-server

2. Change the default password of MySQL Server using:
sudo mysql_secure_installation
Last 2 options are no and rest are yes. I think there are only 3 options.

This option will change the password of the root user

3. Check the status of My SQL Server using:
sudo service mysql status
Replace the 'status' with stop, then check for inactive, then start and check for active state

4. Login to mySQL Server using:
sudo mysql -u root -p
the password from step 2

5. mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Try to connect to the Database using Dbeaver with no database selected localhost and password from step 2

If "Access Denied for user 'root@localhost'", then use following:

    a. UPDATE mysql.user SET plugin = 'mysql_native_password', authentication_string = PASSWORD('Enter_New_Password') WHERE User = 'root';
	b. FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

The password for current Mysql is Root#123
Then check again in dbeaver




Then in venv install MysqlClient

1. Get the pre-requiste bindaries using:
sudo apt-get install python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev build-essential

2. Install MysqlClient using:
pip install mysqlclient


After django-admin is installed and project and app has been created
1. Change the Database in Settings.py by replacing:
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'myDB',
        'USE'R: 'root',
        'HOST' : 'localhost',
        'PORT' : '3306',
        'PASSWORD': 'Root#123'
    }
}


2. Make Migrations using:
python manage.py makemigrations

3. Run Migrations using:
python manage.py migrate

4. Run the Django Server. It will connect to the Mysql

4. At last check in dbeaver for new Tables created or not. If some new tables are created then they must belong to django and hence it is connected
